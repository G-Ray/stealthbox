```
configuration: ~/flexget
service: flexget
```

### Others

#### [nginx](http://nginx.org/en/)

[nginx](http://nginx.org/en/) \[engine x\] is an HTTP and reverse proxy
server.

```
configuration: /etc/nginx
service: nginx
```

## Configuration

### Flexget

Flexget is installed in [Daemon](http://flexget.com/wiki/Daemon) mode.

Configuration file is `/home/box/flexget/config.yml`, and will be
automatically reloaded in Daemon when changed.

### Use your own SSL certificate

Self-signed SSL certificate is generated when running the container for the
first time. But self-signed certificates generates warning in browser when
trying to connect.

To avoid this warning, you can use a certificate from trusted authority, and load them in StealthBox. [StartSSL](https://www.startssl.com) can provide free trusted certificate.

- Replacing certificate in container

Your can use your own SSL certificate by replacing `stealthbox.key` and
`stealthbox.crt` in `/home/box/ssl/`, using Pydio or SSH. This will reload
web server automatically.

- Using certificate from host

Instead of replacing certificate files in container, you can also load volumes
pointing to certificate on the host.

```bash
docker run -d \
  -v /home/docker/ssl/stealthbox.key:/home/box/ssl/stealthbox.key:ro \
  -v /home/docker/ssl/stealthbox.crt:/home/box/ssl/stealthbox.crt:ro \
  -p 8443:443 -p 8022:22 -p 6881:6881 \
  --restart always \
  --name stealthbox \
  toilal/stealthbox
```

Make sure correct access rights are defined.

```bash
chown 1000:1000 \
  /home/docker/ssl/stealthbox.key \ 
  /home/docker/ssl/stealthbox.crt

chmod 400 /home/docker/ssl/stealthbox.crt
```

### Disable SSL

You may have good reasons to do this, but nginx also listen on `tcp/80` for raw
connections. So you can map this port instead of `tcp/443`.

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 8080:80 -p 8022:22 -p 6881:6881 \
  --name stealthbox \
  --restart always \
  toilal/stealthbox
```

Web server will then be available at `http://<stealthbox>:8080`.

### tcp/6881

`tcp/6881` is the port use by Torrent protocol in deluge. Your have to map
this port on the same host port.

If tcp/6881 is not available on host, or if you really need to change this
port, you have to configure deluge for port to match, in web UI, or in 
`/home/box/.config/deluge/core.conf` (`listen_ports` parameter).
